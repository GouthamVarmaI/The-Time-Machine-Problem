    "article": "\n\n Senate not a session\n\n HoUsEIF RkPEHsFKrATtyEs An abstract of ,e Chiasre treaty xSs laid before the House l,s tle Pres'dfn, of the United States, sinilar tlie message se three days since 10 the Senate. The message was read and referred to tbe committee an ioreign affairs. The President recom- meuds the establishment of Consular Agency aI Ckjna similar to thai of other Governments The House then resumed ihe Texas discussion. Mr. nfemgooe, of Va, was entitled to the floor - He said that he was h favor of the annexation of Texas, and tlla Il WIS time 10 harmnnise 0fimions ln favor nf the measure For the plan hastily con sidered and reported by lhe committee foreign re- lnions he could mol vote. IL seemed to him like inc lasi ex\"lrIng effort of ihe Tyler Administrations IL proposed o revive ami raliy in toiiden rerbs a re. jecied treaty, and the act could receive his sup por.\n\n Mr. Dromgoole then argued to show and quoted Mir Adams to prove that II unconstItuiiona to acquire foreign territory beyond the Consttu tionaI limits by he Leg eislature. l5ut siii Congress could admit new States, and Texas couli be admitted us the State of Texas. Mr. D. thought there were pre- denls for hls views la the admission of Rhode Is- 5i. C0nnecIicu and Vermont. These States we're\n\n arded as foreign territory before they were admit lsd iuo the Union. and lmpost dui ies were n,pdsed pon them upon other foreign territory before they lame into the Union. ..\n\n Mir D. spoke oi inc indebtedness of Texhs in con fusion of his remarks. He coniended that we need p become responsible fol ihis indeb edHess, inas-\n\n ch as Texas Would be a sovereignty and could pay\n\n own debts, beIng Jeff with Ihe power to do so by\n\n possession of her lands. H.r\n\n Barnard of New-Y ntk. spoke an hour aga inst ahhskation and E,lowed hy\n\n Mr. Adam aho said he had been mnst reluctant to take pan in ihs debate The inc.inaan of his heart and mind was 10 remam silent io ihe end, un- der the ample discussion the subject had received by large portion of ihis House\n\n Circumstances, however, applying personally and peculiarly repaired him lospe\"k, and t was with rx- reme relucIanre that he rose al all and yet the subject referred to affecting his character hel at home and 10 pos erHy, he could net remain silent\n\n Some time in be month of July, IS43, he passed from Montreal tn n\"ah.c Aie'na .f IoO a.:Ias in eleven hours In the course of the even,ng ,nd by the pleasant light of tine innou ersalion with young countr,men of his, he remarked\n\n \"What magnificent river ' ''Yes,\" was the re . ply of his companion, \"aud il must be ours D\n\n tBn for an injunction of olden time, \"Thou shalt not covet. Il miehi be, was my answer\n\n \"Yes, bui nature has given 1t to us t' was the re- spoiise sand we must have il '\n\n Mr. A. was reminded of this sentiment by the de- m md made here for the annexation of Texas, ana il occurs 10 me as the only unanswerabl argument have n\" heard Tn ihe pending debate. This Il principle more aPpropr,Ele to other Governments than our own All other arguments, however, which have been used, said MT. are founded upon Inl;l- ginaiion and not upon facts\n\n The question: which we have had befnre us until this tune Is upon Joint Resolution for the annex atIon of Territory In that Joint Resolution was stated the argument for ihe measure II was preced- ed by preamble, which contained imagination and noi aci. u was so in what said of cession md m what was said of the Federal Consti ulion. The fact was assumed that all that country known as Texas was ceded and conveyed to the United States. He denied this, and the thaefore, hiCh closed ihe Preamble went for nothirg.\n\n It had been assaned fact that hy the treaty of 1853, all the country called Texas cedrd to\n\n That gentleman, iMr. Douglass of Ili.) win ge- nins and emphasis peculiar to his eloquenre puIliod to me as the origin of the proposition buy rexrs So far il was true, but he failed to add That this purchase was b be made by common consent, wht t. iis now we propose 10 take the country by force - l here was all the difference between his prOpusIi | and that proposed that there wns between D r. chase and burglary. As Judge he can understand that. He Mir. A. admitted that he always was in favor of extending the jurisdiction of the Unit ed States to the Rio Del Nore, If the people owning the territory would consent and if Slavery was abosh- ed.\n\n When he made the proposition to buy Texas, there was no Slavery there. Give us Texas with the con sent of it's owners, and without Saves, and will go to the Rio del Norte tomorrow. Unhappy us the country of Mexico now was, by civil war, there were no Slaves there, and there when he proposed negotiations for e anne Nation of Texas Iu the United States. The treaty then read to show that the Texas claimed now wafs no part of the Texas thai belonged 10 Louisiana. The people, places, settlements, V c were referred to.to prove lhis IL Mexico tlra the proposition wns made and referred by his au thoriy, and by that country Il was refused time and again.\n\n M. Jefferson's authority Qlth May, 1892, ] after the session ol Louisiana by Spain France, was re. erred to as bearing upon the subject, and where the 1 Mississippi only was claimed as the boundary be tween the two countries. Mir Madison msiruc ed the Minister to spain, (Mr. Pinkney) on the auhori \" of Mir. Jefferson, as President, guarantee ta Spa in the Mississippi river the boundary. If his hour allowed him, Mr. A. sad, he should colr,e 10 iie time when the negotiation was broken l ,p,, r .l..- Further 10 show that Texas was not ours by the Loalsiana treaty, Mir. Adams quoted from Mir. Jef. ferson m leO3, where Mir. J. said inormat ion as to Louisiana is imperfect. The boundaries are he said, the highlands of the Mississippi. We have some claim to go 10 tine Rio del Norte and better to go to the Redillo, the ancient boundaries of Louisa Da. And further, he said if we push our claim st ly we shall get the Furas.\n\n Where did MT. Jefferson say that the claims o tue treaty oi lSO3 gave any clalms to Texas? All that was expected was the Foridas, and that only pushing great claim. Mir J was further quoted ss showing that all thIs to he upon negotiations with the Spanish Government The negotiat ion commenced and all the country WAS involved in it beyond the Mississippi.\n\n Mir. Adams having been referred to, as being con. necied with the only propositions acquire foreign territory, be replied with spirit. He and his State might well have been spared this nsidious-he would make no qualification of the term--assaut. The cit izen of what State is 1t that is referred to? e said\n\n \n\n had lo Oregon l claim II as my own, said MT. Adams. The Oregon discovered b, citizen O. Massachusetts, and The treaty of 1879 makes strong and perfect thIs claim of discovery.\n\n The line \"f 42 deg. was proposed by me in the q bInet of Mir. MonrDe. do not aim il, how. yer IL belonged to MT. Monroe. We had the right ,., Oregon under this Florida treaty and upon my prop. osIiion The matter would have gone to his grave with him, but for tle insdious reflections against him and his State. He said il for the honor of bis State.\n\n Many citizens considered the ella i'm from 42o to 54e ours upon the most undoubted security. have a greater interest in hs subject than any other person have, identified with II have been I believe ur claim 10 the territory good one hut feel in much '.'ult whether shall be able sustain il. l am, howev yer, for sustaining it, though have doubts whether 1t will be sustained; but if it is, it must be by the treaty of 1919, III winch he acted most con spicuous part.\n\n in regard 10 the claim up for Texas, if it was true, we had right 10 make il, ina sInuch as we had no right 10 do what claimed to do. We cannot, t, said MT. A. transfer people from country to ano- ther.\n\n The constitutional question glanced nt. Mir. Adams did moi doubt that we had right to acquire territory by conquest or purchase. H.1\n\n He had conveI sed ih Mir. Madison frequently upon tIs subject and he agreed with him thai men with uinan rights md immortal souls could mol be trans erred from one counir, 10 another.

    "article": "THE HOME MARKET.\n\n The advocates of pr0tectjUc tari6 are averse to a commercial treaty between lis country and England, because, say they, We should send more grain and meat to tha, country, and take of her far more clothes, wares Sc. in return. Commerce would, for a brief season, be stimulated, but our manu- lactres would be shaken and crippled, if not prostrted; and our agriculture, compelled to seek a market across the ocean for east sur plus product, would be doomed to subsist on low prices forever.' This argument is quite curiosity in logic. If t were said that ag- riculture, tied down to home market, by laws prohibiting free interchange of com modiles between different nations, would be doomed to subsist on low prices forever one could see something approaching com mon sence in 1t; but to say that the opening to us ol new market, where all tarm pro- ducts are much higher than here at home, must produce that effect, is refinement in polilico-economcal logic that would puzzle a Philadelphia lawyer, or any other erproblem- solver, to explain. If il is meant that the dimuntion of the northern and eastern man. ufactuIing markets would be so great as to outweigh the entire market of Great Britain, with her twenty-five millions of souls, then we can but marvel at the credulity presumed in the public It is doubtful whether, if the restrictions upon foreign trade were perma- nently reduced to the standard of the com promise act, one single pound of pork, or one bushel less of corn, would thereby be consumed in the eastern markets A Prohl- biiory or high protective tariff is, therefore, maintained at the direct cost of the agricul- tugal interest, to the exclusive benefit of the home manufacturer, when the currency is down to the minimum point, and to the pro- fit of the foreign manufacturer when the eur rency is so inflated as to nullify the effects oi protection, as it frequently has been.\n\n Philadelphia Ledger.",

The police had\nbeen despatched in pursuit-but, OF course, their\nchances of apprehending the refractory absentees\nare altogether dubious.

    "article": "Farias, had rendered himself particularly obnoxious to Santa Anna, and his party: so that, to avoid trusting him with the powers of the government during his absence from the capital, that President, by majority of both Houses of Congress, had him declared morally incapable of holding an office to which he tad been duly elected, and Bar ragan was appointed 'sPresidents interiao,s or acting President in his stead. The re- port of the co nmittee which recommended the act, denounces F lrias in the strongest manner, and accuses him of the most atro- cions conduct. La Oposicion of the 31st January, speaks with great warmth against this high handed proceeding -and says, we should think with some justice, ''the resolu- lion which has been adopted in inc general Congress, with respect to the Vice Presi- dent. IS of such nature that with if has vanished the last faint shadow ef coastits= tionai order-and it has delivered every thing over in the hands of illegal power.n Parties seem to run as high in this distract ed country, and produce to the full, as evil effects as military dissension did formerly, and yet Mexico is allowed to enjoy greater tranquility than has yet been known in this country! Santa Anna's speech to the Con- gross, on his taking leave, contains no re- mark of importance.\n\n By dates from Mexico, to the 2d March, we have received advices of the resignation of Santa Anna, of the chief magistracy of the Mexican republic. The Congress hay ing nominaily accepted his resignation, they ordered the election of President for sub seqpent day; and elected General Miguel Barragan, President during the interval through the influence of Santa Anna. By a third decree of the Congress, the office of Vice President was declared null; so that Gomez Faras was obliged to resign; a commotion appeared the order of the day, secretly agitated by Santa Anna. that the necessity of his more permanently resnming his authority, might be rendered more os- tensible.\n\n It is not unlikely that, at the election for President, as decreed, Santa Anna will be elected perpetual chief magistrate or dicta- tor of the fallen republic.

He died in about the 5sth year of his\nage, leaving behind him but one cfiild-a young\ndaughterto inherit his fortunes, his softer virtues,\nand his name, Her mother was the sister OF\nJames Lyons, esq, the present delegate ofthe city\n\n\nHe left no childrenaby his first wife, who was the\nsister of VIM.

Roane was among Che most eminent men\n\n\nof the State; and perhaps it is scarcely too much\nTO say of him, the most popular man in all its\nbroad borders He had almost every quality to\nendear him to bis people. He had all the agdor\nand enthusiasm in favor of popular rig ghts and OF\nthe rights of the Statess all the RrmBess, energy,\nand enthusiasm, which distinguished his ce1ebrat-\ned father, Judge Spencer Roane ; and he occasion.\nally threw out some of the eloquence and genius\nof his illustrious grandfather, Patrick Henry. He\n\n\nwas a bold thinker and q fearless speaker. He\nSeemed to possess an almost instructive attachment\nof the cause of republican .prineiries, and he adj\n\n\nhered to them. with tenacity of hooks of steel.\nSometimes he would surprise his audience with\nthe boldness of bis propositions, and then remove\ntheir difficulties with flashes of argument as sud\nden and resistless as stroke of lightning He\n\n\nhad an ardor in his character which was some\ntimes too exciabEe, but which showed, in its very\nexcess the honesty ofthe man. and the devotion of\nthe politician. Withal, he was republican,; in\nhis manners stern though he sometimes was, yet\nhe was equaLi in his department to all classes of\nthe people, af1ectlonate 10 his disposition and al\n\n\nways hospitabIe in bis house. There was no\nstaHncher republican in the Union than VIM. H.\nRoane; none more honest in his life-none more\npatriotic in his feelings.

Roane at once among the most effective speak\ners of the Senate of the United States.

    "article": "In compliance with his promise to US last week,\nour Correspondent, the author of the calculations\nheretofore published has kindly put into our hands\nthe following reflections and explanations as to the\nproposed undertaking, to which we invite the at\ntenton of the public:\n\n\nMr. HoEDEN: In relation TO the cost Of con-\nstructng Rail Roads il is belle we'd that the opinion\ngenerally prevails that it be accomplished only\nby enormous expenditure; and that belief has\nbeen based on the cost Of Roads that were in pro-\ngresS between 1888 and tS40-a period in which\nthe spirit for Rail Roads amounted almost TO\nmania, when materials and labor in such de-\nmand as 10 bring extravagaut prices, and when\nmany Of the worksNYere carried under such pecu\nnarV embaIrassments still increase much more\nthe prices exacted for their construction. Compar-\ned with such works the estimate published in your\npaper o. the 10Th instant, may seem low, so much\nso that it may not tie deemed improper offer\nsome explanations, both regards the route and\nother data on which that estimate was based.\n\n\n1t is believed that all who may be acquainted\nwith the physical and geological character of the\ncountry. will confess that so favorable a route\nfor Rail Road is rarely to be met with (both\nas regards the face of the country and the faci-\nties for procuring superior timber) would be\nafforded between Raleigh and Fayetteville. On\nleaving Raleigh, which is an elevated point, by\nproceeding West for a few miles continuous\nridge will be found to pass the heads Of Walnut\nand Swift Creeks-thence Southerly, between the\nwaters of Cape Fear and South Rivers, without\nencounterng any water-course until it would reach\nthe Cape Fear opposite Fayetteville; or Road\nmay take direct course from the head of Swift\nCreek towards Fayetteville, and cross the Cape\nFear near McNeilfs Alkins's Ferries, encoun-\ntering no stream north of the Cape Fear, and\nbut two south Of that river, or between it and Fay\nettevle; and these, il is believed, may be passed\nat small cost of bridging. On either route the\ngrading may be economical and easy.\n\n\nThe estimate Tor grading was based on the ac-\ntual cost of grading Road 200 miles from this\nplace-a work that has been executed within the\nlast twelve months; and though that route may\nnot be considered favorable as that from Raleigh\nto Fayetteville yet to preclude the possibility of too\nlow an estimate, 25 per cent has been added to\nthe actual cost per mile of grading that road.\nThe estimate for bridging may be too liberal, as it\nmay not be necessary to elevate them high above\nthe stream-thereby avoiding large expenditure\nfor masonaEy and embankment which is usually\nan important item attending the crossing of\nstreams which much depressed below the sur\nrounding country. The estimate for Railing was\nbased on the highest price paid by the Raleigh and\nCASTOR Rail Road Company, when delivered on\nthe Road at any point in Wake country !; and the\ncross ties Tor sils) and keys at the maximum price\nwhen delivered anY point between Raleigh and\nCASTOR. Both rails and cross, ties dressed aud\nframed ready prepared TO be laid IN the Roads by\nthose who furnish them. Hence, the timber re-\nuuring no further process of preparations the esti\nmate for the superstTucton would seem large and\nas to the material Itself, the Raleigh and CASTOR\nRoad passing as it does througha country almost\ndestitute of suitable timber for Rail Road, and\n\n\n",
