He advocated training. college students in their junior and senior years along the same lines as now are being used al the military camp of instruction here.\n\n General Wood said the country has three sources from which to draw of- ficers from private life. First, of these, he asserted, were men who had been in the regular service or militia. Second. ne would obtain officers from a list of men kept by the war department and who have qualified by examinations. The third source would be from mil ttary schools or institutions in which some military training is given.\n\n For an army of 1,250, 900, General Wood said, the nation would need 40.- 000 officers. From these 1900 should De chosen each year for special grades or the service. These men eventually he would have become the higher grade of officers for volunteers.\n\n Referring to military service. Gen eral Wood said\n\n NO one has a right to consider his discharge of duty as a soldier as vol intary. This duty is an obligation that Is binding upon all who are mentally and physically fit and within certain age limits. A man has no more right to speak of volunteering to discharge his duties to the nation as a soldier than he has to talk of volunteering to obey any moral law or pay his just debts\"\n\n General Wood also took a strong stand against waiting until time of war to organize a volunteer army He said such plan would be about as effective as waiting until a fire broke out to organize volunteer fire com pany. Soldiers enlisted at such times, he said, would not know what was ex- pected of them.",

Robert was born fin 1911 and was educated at Ballilol College. Oxford. He probably came to this country in one of the regular trading vessels that piled between England and the colony at Rich- monds Island, Me. He is mentioned in an old record as 'an orthodox divine of the Church of England of great parts and estate.' The great parts. of course, he owed to his superior inheritance and education; but for his great estate was indebted to his wife, who, on the death of her father, was the heiress of many thousands of acres, besides a very con- siderable amount of money for those days\n\n It Is said, 10 the great credit of this family. that it was owing to the infiu- ence of this enlightened man that the witchcraft madness that was sweeping through the neighborhood colonies at a bout this time never penetrated into Maine.

We crossed a bridge high in the air; they call this Suicide Bridge, for there have been several who discOn- nected themselves from the life princi- pie by jumping off and being drowned in the river below.\n\n Speaking of the Sears -Roebuck Plant, will say that it is immense. You enter large room and a man notifies you that at a certain time a guide will show all through who wish to see it, and very interesting place it is.\n\n I have forgotten the number of acres it covers, the amount of goods that are sold from there yearly, the number of clerks employed, etc., but to those who visit Chicago, would say, go to the Sears Roebuck wholesale establishment and you will see very interesting little city all by itself.\n\n They have their reading rooms, their recreation grounds, their ball field, and all that goes to make life worth while for their clerks and employees. You are taken to the top of the tower from which you can see all over the sur rounding country and get the lay of the city, the lake and all that interests one along this line.
