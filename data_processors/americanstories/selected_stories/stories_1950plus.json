I want to keep my equilib-\nrum. I have achieved every\nthing a man can achieve in pro\nbasketball\"\n\n\nChamberlain told newsmen\nyesterday racial problems had\nsome connection with my de-\ncision but that wasn't the\nentire reason\" He did not\nelaborate, other than to say he\nwas not referring to his team\nmates.\n\n\nIl don't think he realized the\npunishment he would\nhave to take\" Johnston said.\nHe took more than his share\"\n\n\nChamberlain previously had\ncomplained Of rough treatment\nand double and triple teaming\nby opposing teams to keep his\nscoring and rebounding down.\n\n\nNew League RumOred\n\n\nMeanwhile, in Chicago, Abe\nSaperstein, owner of tn e\nHarlem Globetrotters, for whom\nChamberlain played before\njoining the Warriors. said he\ncouldn't say whether Wilt\nwould rejoin the Trotters.\nSaperstein, who also is part\nowner of the Warriors, said he\nhasn't been in touch with him.\nChamberlain was paid $65. 900\nfor his years stint with the\nGlobetrotters after he left the\nUniversity of Kansas where he\nwas an All-America two years.\n\n\nSaperstein denied a report\nthat Chamberlain would join\nthe Los Angeles entry in a new\npro basketball league planned\nby Saperstein.\n\n\nThe promoter said ne still\nb elieved Chamberlain's an\nnouncement came because the\nplayer was dead tired and ex-\nhausted\" after a grueling NBA\ncampaign.\n\n\nIl think all Wilt really wants\nto do is stay In bed a week or\ntwo and rest up,\" Saperstein\nsaid.",

A groaning dinner table\nmay give way to a bulging re-\nIfrigerator a few hours after\nthe meal Is finished and your\nfamily has departed, contented\nand at peace with the world.\n\n\nJust as Thanksgiving means\nturkey, the day after Thanks\ngiving often means listening to\n''Not turkey for dinner =\nagain.\" If your family is the\ntype that would rather not see\nturkey for a while, you can\n/ freeze meal-size portions of\nleftover meat in moisture\nvapor proof containers, notes\nMiss Janet Coblentz, extension\nfood and nutrition specialist at\nthe University of Delaware.\nThen, week or more after\nthe holiday, surprise them with\nturkey pie, turkey and waffles\nor Turkey Divan. Turkey meat\nshould be stored no longer than\none to two months, Miss Cob\nlentz adds.\n\n\nDon't make the mistake of\nletting hot meats stand out un-\ntil cold before refrigerating\nthem. This is a risky practice\nand may invite food poisoning\nContrary to an age-old tale,\nmeat doesn't lose its flavor\nwhen refrigerated at once. Re-\nfrigerate it Immediately, or\ncool quickly and then refriger-\nate. Never let cooked meat stand\nout longer than TWO hours, and\nIf not stored in the freezer,\nplan to use it within four days.\nDressing doesn't cool as quick :\nly as the meat. To prevent\nspoilage, it should be removed\nand stored in separate con-\ntainer.\n\n\nCooked sliced turkey is tas-\nlilly prepared many different\nways. For mouth h-Watering\nTurkey Divan, place layer of\ncooked broccoli in an oblong\nIpan or casserole. top with Sill\nIces of turkey and then with che\n'lese sauce. Slip under the broil-\ner to Drown, or bake at $50 de-\ngrees F. for rs minutes. Cover\nwith French fried onion rings\nand continue to heat for five\nminutes.\n\n\nServe creamed turkey made\nwith gravy, cream sauce or a\ncondensed soup in number of\ntempting ways = on rice or\nnoodle rings, cornbread, toast\ned English mullins, or Chinese\nnoodles.\n\n\nTurkey pie for four or six\npersons can be made quickly\nIn the broiler. Line a butter\ned 10\" x 6\" 2\" baking dish\nwith TWO cups of hot mashed\nwhite or sweet potatoes. Cover\nwith turkey slices. Topping is\nmade with two cups of medium\n: white sauce, one cup drained\n: cooked carrots and one cup\ndrained cooked peas. Miss Cob\nlentz notes that this also might\nbe used to disguise leftover\nvegetables. Broil until golden\nbrown and serve\n\n\nAnd IL your family still COM\nplains, ask them just how many\ntimes year do they expect to\neat leftover turkey.",
