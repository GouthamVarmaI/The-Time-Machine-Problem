But why, I fay, fhou'd any at all cf the truly vertuous be concern d, if thofe who are not fo are dtftmguijh'dfrom 'em ? For by that Mask of modefty which Women wear prom ifcuou fly in public k, they are all alike, and you can no more know q. kept Wench fir dm a Woman of Honour by her Looks,' than by her Drefs ; for thofe who are of Quality without Honour ( if any fuch' the^e are) they have their Quality to fet off their falfe modefty, as well as their falfe Jewels, and you muft no more fufpetl their Countenances for counterfeit, than their Pendants, though as the Plain-Dealer, Mentz'ms fiys, Eles envoy- .ent leur confcience au Bordel, & teinnent leur -countenance en regie: But thofe who aft as they look, ougln not -to 'be fcanda/ized at the re- prehenfion of others faults, left they tax themfelves with 'em, and by too delicate and quick an apprehenfion, not only make that obfcene which I meant innocent, but that Satyr on all, which was intended on- ly on -thofe who deferv'd it. But, Madam, I beg your pardon for this digreffion, to civil Women and Ladies of Honour, fince you and I fhall never be the better for 'em ; for a Comic Poet, and a Lady of your frofeffion, make moft of the other fort, and the Stage and your Houfes, like our Plantations, are propagated by the leaft nice Women ; and, as with- tbe Minifters of Juftice, the Vices of the Age are our befl bu- finefs. But now I mention Publick Perfons, I can no longer defer do- ing you the Juftice of a Dedication, and telling you your own-, who are, of all publick-fpirited People, the moft neceffary, moft communi -cative, moft generous and hof pit able-, your houfe has been the houfe of the People, your Sleep fill difturb'd for the Publick, and when you arofe, 'twas that others might lye doivn, and you waked that o- thers might reft; the good you have done is unfpeakabh; How many young unexperienc'd Heirs have you kept from rajh foolifh Marriages ? and from being jilted for their lives by the ivorft fort of Jilts, Wives ? How many unbewitchfd Widowers Children have you preferved from the Tyranny of Stepmothers ? How many old Dotards form. Cuckoid- age, and keeping other mens Wenches and Children? How many Adulteries and unnatural Sins have you prevented ? In fine, you have been a conftant fcourge to the old Le-cher, and often a terrour to the young? you have made cone upifce nee its own punijhment and extinguifhed Luft with Luft, like blowing up of Houfes to ftop the fire.
